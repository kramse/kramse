### Hey everyone, I'm kramse 

**kramse/kramse** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in my own company Zencurity and as a teacher at KEA / KEA Kompetence
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on network based open source like Zeek and Suricata, because I use them a lot
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Git and Github all the time, seems I cannot remember it at all 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about information security and networking, especially IPv6
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email is probably best hlk@kramse.org
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I windsurf as much as possible
